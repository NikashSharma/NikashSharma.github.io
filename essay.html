<p>As AI becomes more prevalent in business and society, the question becomes how to build a sustainable moat around these AI businesses. One key factor will be talent, as those with the best people will likely build the best models. However, this alone may not be enough, as a competitor with a strong team could still train their model from the output of a pre-existing model.</p>

<p>Another factor will be computing costs, as those able to drive down the cost of queries will have a competitive advantage. This could be achieved through a focus on infrastructure or through the optimization of their own AI product.</p>

<p>The most important factor, however, may be proprietary data and access to it. Training data and access to it will be crucial for the success of any AI model, and businesses and consumers alike will become more vigilant about protecting their data and restricting access to it. As we've seen with OpenAI's Whisper, entire outputs from existing businesses can be used as inputs for an AI model, and the quality of the resulting AI product is directly tied to the quality of the input data. This could lead to intense creative destruction and a move towards restricting data access, as businesses and consumers alike seek to protect their data and maintain a competitive advantage (or even try and resist business model disruption). The shift from an open-source system to a closed-source system could have significant implications for the ability to iterate and progress in the industry, and it's worth considering the potential impact of these important factors.</p>

<p>It's also interesting to consider how much better competing AI models will be relative to each other and whether the rate of improvement will be marginal. If one company gets ahead, will the next competing AI be significantly better to justify market disruption? And when improvements become marginally less impactful, where do we go from there? It's possible that some AI firms may specialize in training their models on specific data sets, while others may achieve general AI that can cannibalize all others. Ultimately, access to data and the value of input datasets will be crucial in determining the moat of these AI businesses.</p>

<p>The key to building a sustainable moat around AI businesses is talent, computing costs, and access to proprietary data. The most important factor will likely be access to high-quality data, as the success of an AI model is directly tied to the quality of its input data. Companies will likely become more protective of their data and may restrict access to it in order to maintain a competitive advantage. However, the shift from an open-source system to a closed-source system could have significant implications for the industry, and it's worth considering the potential impact of these factors. Additionally, it's interesting to consider how much better competing AI models will be relative to each other and whether the rate of improvement will be marginal.
